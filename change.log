* 0.1.1
- Versioning :)
- Blocks now appear above (outside of) the playing field
- Condition for game ending changed: the game ends if after a collision, the
  current block has pixels outside the field. These last two changes solve
  the painting-over-existing-blocks issue, and others too. I am also sure they
  introduce a lot new problems, too :)
